**Files in this Folder**

* These files are the known eruptions but mapped with spatial points for mapping in Tableau. There are multiple files needed for processing. 

**How were these files obtained**

* Using Alteryx (see subfolder for specific flows created), I was able to use the "spatial points" feature to save each coordinate in this format.

**Why are these files important**

* It was necessesary to convert the eruption coordinates to this format because then I was able to layer these points on top of the tectonic plate information in a dual axis map that could provide more insight into the locations of volcanoes.
