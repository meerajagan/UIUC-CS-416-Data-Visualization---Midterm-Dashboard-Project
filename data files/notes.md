**What are the Files in this Repo used for dashboarding**
* 'eruptions_fixed_types' - the eruptions fixed data sheet. This is the sheet we will use as a root to make sure we are only looking at volcanoes that have known eruptions.
* 'eruption_plate_mapping' - this sheet maps the eruption centroids (lat/long coords) to its corresponding tectonic plate.
* 'volcanoes_fixed_types' - the type fixed volcano data sheet. This sheet will give us extra information about each of the volcanoes with eruptions.
